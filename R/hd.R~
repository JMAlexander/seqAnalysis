## Identify positions of HD associated 8-mers within a given sequence
## Input sequence
## Output matrix of relative positions and E-scores

# Matrix of 8-mer E-scores from Berger, Cell, 2008
# 32896 rows of 8-mers
# 180 columns: 1-2 are 8-mer sequence and reverse complement, 3-180 are HD
# E-scores computed by
#   - defining 'foreground' (contains given 8-mer sequence) or 'background' (does not contain)
#   - took top half of each set and computed a modified Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney stat (essentially comparing ranks) scaled to be invariant for sample size
#Data ranged from -0.5 to 0.5
